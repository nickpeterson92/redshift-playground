# Redshift to Redshift Serverless Migration Strategy

## Migration Approaches

### 1. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) - Recommended for Large Datasets
- **Pros**: Minimal downtime, CDC support, automated
- **Cons**: Additional service cost, complexity
- **Best for**: Production migrations with strict SLAs

### 2. UNLOAD/COPY Method - Recommended for Learning
- **Pros**: Simple, full control, cost-effective
- **Cons**: Requires downtime, manual process
- **Best for**: Dev/test environments, learning migrations

### 3. Snapshot Restore - Fastest Method
- **Pros**: Very fast, preserves all objects
- **Cons**: Not available for serverless target
- **Best for**: Cluster-to-cluster only

### 4. AWS Redshift Data Sharing - Zero Downtime
- **Pros**: No data movement, instant access
- **Cons**: Requires same region, ongoing costs
- **Best for**: Gradual migrations

## Chosen Approach: UNLOAD/COPY Method

We'll use UNLOAD/COPY for this learning exercise because:
1. Shows the complete data movement process
2. Teaches important Redshift concepts
3. No additional services required
4. Full visibility into migration steps

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Assessment
- [ ] Analyze source cluster metrics
- [ ] Document table sizes and row counts
- [ ] Identify critical queries
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics

### Phase 2: Preparation
- [ ] Create S3 staging bucket
- [ ] Set up IAM roles and permissions
- [ ] Create target schema in serverless
- [ ] Test connectivity

### Phase 3: Schema Migration
- [ ] Export DDL from source
- [ ] Modify for serverless compatibility
- [ ] Create tables in target
- [ ] Validate schema creation

### Phase 4: Data Migration
- [ ] UNLOAD data to S3 (compressed)
- [ ] COPY data to serverless
- [ ] Validate row counts
- [ ] Run data quality checks

### Phase 5: Object Migration
- [ ] Migrate views
- [ ] Migrate stored procedures
- [ ] Migrate user permissions
- [ ] Update connection strings

### Phase 6: Validation & Testing
- [ ] Compare row counts
- [ ] Run test queries
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Application testing

### Phase 7: Cutover
- [ ] Final sync (if using CDC)
- [ ] Update application connections
- [ ] Monitor performance
- [ ] Decommission old cluster

## Key Considerations

### Performance Optimization
1. **UNLOAD Options**:
   - Use PARALLEL for multiple files
   - Enable GZIP compression
   - Partition by date for incremental loads

2. **COPY Options**:
   - Use PARALLEL for faster loads
   - Set appropriate MAXERROR threshold
   - Use COMPUPDATE PRESET for encoding

### Cost Optimization
1. **S3 Storage**:
   - Use lifecycle policies
   - Clean up after migration
   - Consider S3 storage class

2. **Compute Usage**:
   - Run migration during off-peak
   - Size serverless appropriately
   - Monitor RPU consumption

### Data Validation
1. **Row Count Validation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
          SUM(rows) as row_count
   FROM pg_catalog.svv_table_info
   GROUP BY schemaname, tablename
   ORDER BY row_count DESC;
   ```

2. **Sample Data Comparison**:
   ```sql
   -- Run on both clusters
   SELECT COUNT(*), 
          MIN(date_column), 
          MAX(date_column),
          SUM(numeric_column)
   FROM schema.table;
   ```

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Assessment | 2-4 hours | Cluster access |
| Preparation | 1-2 hours | AWS permissions |
| Schema Migration | 1-2 hours | Target cluster ready |
| Data Migration | 2-8 hours | Depends on data size |
| Object Migration | 1-2 hours | Schema complete |
| Validation | 2-4 hours | Data loaded |
| Cutover | 1-2 hours | All validation passed |

**Total: 10-24 hours** for a complete migration
